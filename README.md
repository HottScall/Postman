My notes from learning how to use postman 


<h2 align="center">CREATING AN API REQUEST</h2>

HAVE YOUR API REQUEST READY

- In this example I googled (sample rest app request) and went on website https://reqres.in/ 
- Then I selected the GET request for SINGLE USER 
- Go to google/notepad/text editor and paste in the the web url https://reqres.in/ and append the get request end point, in this case  for SINGLE USER itâ€™s - api/users?page=2
- Goggle is best as if you enter the entire api request correctly it should display the data as html in the browser 
- So complete request is https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2

 <h3 align="center">Creating a request</h3>	
 
- Create a new workspace (Give it a name and optional description)
- Create a new request in that workspace and give it a request name of your choice, optional description. Then add to existing collection or create a new collection. In this case create a new collection, then select that collection and save the request to the collection. 
- Now within your collection you can add your complete request to the GET request tab. Send it and it should return your data (this is for a simple get requests, other requests can be more complex so follow later in tutorial if request is more complex than a simple get request). 
- Remember to save your response once you have done something with it. 
	
<h4 align="center">IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO NOTE</h4>			

Above where the response to your request comes in is some important information:

- Status: You should be looking for 200, which is http request okay, look up http requests if you have anything other than 200.
- Time: How long it took to make the request and return the data 
- Size: Self explanatory, but if you hover over this tab you get the individual size of the body and the headers.
